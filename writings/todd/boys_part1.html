  <h1>Boys Will Be Boys (Part 1)</h1>
  <h2>By Chad A. Steed</h2>
  <h3>December 9, 2017</h3>
  </center>

  <br/>
  <p>The deluge of rain relented on the last day of spring break. Released from a week of confinement, Todd and I resolved to salvage what remained of our brief break from the books.  There were many options, but we needed something that would be exciting, extraordinary, and outdoors.  Floating the nearby Okatoma River seemed ideal, so we hopped up in my old Ford Ranger and drove to an outdoor adventure store on the river where we rented a battered aluminum canoe.  Without hesitation or a liability waiver, the guide took our money and drove us upstream to the launch point that was hidden beneath a small bridge near Seminary, Mississippi.  The guide was a chipper fellow about 5 years our senior, and he talked nonstop about people he knew from our school.  As we finalized our preparations and sat in the canoe, he remarked that most people shied away during flood conditions.  With that comment and the sight of vortexes spawned by the turbulent water flowing around the bridge pillars, there may have been a brief moment of doubt.  But any second thoughts were short lived, as the guide wished us good luck, with a slight snicker, and shoved us off from the shore with a kick from his muddy boot.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the current snatched our vessel and propelled us downstream like a runaway roller coaster.  Glancing over my shoulder, Todd and I shared an uneasy glance as the plight to which we had so eagerly subjected ourselves became apparent.  With no time to lament our decision, we set our minds and energy on one seemingly simple goal:  not flipping the canoe.  A simple goal, maybe, but it would not be easy since the river's goal was in direct opposition to ours and tipping over on that day would spell disaster.  But this wasn't our first brush with danger, and it wasn't long before the paddles felt like extensions of our arms that we used to control our speed and steer toward the least threatening lanes.  Although there were no other people on the river that day, we weren't entirely alone.  We noticed logs, debris, and a couple of water moccasins nearby &mdash; yet more incentive to remain in the canoe.  When we hit the deep spots, we rejoiced as they gave us time to catch our breath.  But rapids were more common where we bumped and scraped against the rocks and fought to remain straight.  Over the roar of the rushing water, we shouted to coordinate our actions and openly debated the blame for our predicament.  We swept by the 1-hour pickup point, unable to reach the sandbar and indirectly committed ourselves to the full 3-hour float.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the trip was a fight against the sinister will of the angry river, but with each small victory we accumulated confidence and near the end we felt more excitement than fear.  When we saw the outdoor adventure store, which marked the end of the float, we mustered one last burst of energy paddling for the shore.  By God's great mercy, we ran aground on the sandbar, pulled our canoe out of the water, and took a seat at the water's edge.  We congratulated one another, but agreed never to repeat the experience.  As the guide emerged from the store he picked up where he left off, rattling additional names of his acquaintances that he had remembered since shoving us off.  As he collected our gear, he informed us that we finished the 3-hour float in just under an hour.  For a rainy spring break, it ended on a high note.</p>

  <p>Floating the Okatoma at flood stage was just one of the many exciting adventures that Todd and I shared in our quest to enjoy life.  We didn't flirt with disaster often, but when we did the experience tended to be memorable and sometimes downright terrifying.  We never rose in the morning with the intent to subject ourselves to harm; rather the predicaments were usually the result of inexperience, overconfidence in our abilities, or just bad luck.  That we survived, usually unscathed, seemed to only be explicable through the direct intervention of God.</p>

  <p>Our generation, dubbed Generation X, was characterized by latchkey kids who came home to empty houses until our parents returned from their work.  I was a latchkey kid, except I had a tendency to forget my key inside.  In such situations, my only way in was to crawl through the small window over the kitchen sink, which my mom always left open for this purpose.  We were given a certain amount of freedom to roam without direct adult supervision, for the most part, on the condition that we obeyed the rules.  Such independence was feasible due to the safe, close-knit community that surrounded us.  If we did break the rules or found ourselves in need of help, the watchful eyes of our neighbors would see and intervene.  With such freedom, we seemed to mature quickly as we learned valuable lessons about life, often the hard way.  Each difficult situation we endured strengthened our friendship and supplied ample memories to fill in future conversations.</p>

  <p>While the early years of our childhood were generally uninteresting, there were a few rather traumatic experiences.  There was the time Todd literally played with fire while trying his hand at cooking solo at home.  In the process, he started a grease fire on the stove, which prompted a call to the Petal Fire Department.  I wasn't with him when it occurred, but I saw and heard the fire trucks racing to his house.  Fortunately, his mom was home and the fire was quickly extinguished with little, if any, damage.  The only casualty that day was Todd's pride.</p>

  <p>Then, there was the time I attempted to change a flat tire on my bike.  I was about 7 years old at the time.  My tool was a cheap knife that I found in my dad's shop while he was at drill duty with the National Guard.  As I grew frustrated at the tool's ineffectiveness, the flimsy blade slipped off the rim and plunged deep into my left wrist, puncturing a major artery.  Oddly, I felt no pain, probably because I was too busy panicking at the sight of the vigorous arc of bright red blood that gushed from my wrist like a geyser.  My mom didn't hear my screams as I sprinted to the house for help because she was on the lawn mower in the front yard &mdash; it was the only time I remembered her cutting the grass.  I rushed into our home and ran down the hall to my sister's room where she was on the phone with her door locked.  I often pestered her, especially while she was on the phone, so, naturally, she ignored my pleads for help telling me to go away and leave her alone.  Then, in what I have often considered one of my most ingenious acts, I pressed my wrist under the door so that the blood jetted into her room.  It worked like a charm as she immediately thrust open the door, rushed me to the bathroom, wrapped my wrist in a towel, told me to hold it tight, and bolted outside to get mom.  My mom rushed in, loaded me into the car, and we headed to the doctor's office.  The efficiency and speed that my sister and mom reacted probably saved my life.  Mom drove with one hand and firmly applied pressure to the blood-soaked towel with her other.  Looking her in the eye, I asked her if I was going to die.  In reply, she assured me that no I wasn't going to die, and I never doubted it.  My tire maintenance attempted earned me 5 stitches and a stern lecture from the doctor about cutting away from the body &mdash; a lesson I wouldn't soon forget.  Meanwhile, my dad came home to a trail of blood from the shop, up the driveway, and into the house: he said it looked like a scene from a horror movie.  Fortunately, Todd wasn't present for that horrific experience.</p>

  <p>The same arm was also subject to a bad burn from Todd's go-kart.  After an afternoon ride, we were putting the go-kart away and needed to lift it, for some odd reason.  We lifted it with Todd hoisting from the front and me the back.  As I stood up, my arm pressed against the hot muffler branding the Briggs & Stratton logo on the skin of my bicep.  And soon I was, once again, riding in the car for an emergency trip to the doctor.  I'm sure it hurt, but Todd's mom later bragged to my mom that I never cried or complained.  Perhaps the knife incident toughened me up.  Todd's mom had a way of complementing me in such situations, which made me forget the bad circumstance.</p>

  <p>We also had our share of broken bones and strains, which never failed to hurt.  I chipped a bone in my hand playing football in Todd's living room, of all places.  It was small chip, but it hurt like heck and I had a hard time explaining it to the doctor.  But it quite the impression on him as for years he would ask about my arena football career.  Like most of our peers, we periodically needed crutches for sprains, breaks, and fractures.  However, in those early years, crutches and, better yet, casts brought instant popularity at school &mdash; everyone wanted to sign the cast.  Furthermore, it also meant automatic permission to leave class early, usually with a friend of our choosing to carry our books.  So, with such perks and the sympathy of the girls, we had few complaints.</p>

  <p>Then one day, while we were playing football in Todd's front yard with Michael, another very good friend, an injury occurred that changed our thinking about broken bones.  Todd was playing all-time quarterback and Michael was running with the football while I played defense.  As Michael turned the corner, I dove head first to tackle him.  His leg bore the full force of the impact as we crashed to the ground.  As we fell there was loud pop that seemed to echo off the trees. It sounded like a rifle shot.  Immediately, Michael started yelling in pain.  It was clear, even to our untrained eyes, that his upper leg was broken.  Later, we learned it was his femur, a portion of the anatomy that etched itself in our minds.</p>

  <p>Once again, the family ambulance was called into action, except this time it was my dad who rushed to the scene.  As my dad worked, it was like watching a scene from the TV show MacGyver.  Dad braced Michael's leg with two wooded boards on either side and secured them with rope.  Together, we lifted Michael up and into the back of dad's Bronco, which he had layered with padding to soften the ride.  I sat in the back allowing Michael to squeeze my hand as tight as necessary while my dad sped down the road, with hazard lights flashing, to the nearest emergency room.  After surgery, Michael laid in traction for several weeks in the hospital while I felt absolutely terrible.  Thankfully, he never blamed me since he knew it was an accident.  In fact, the only complaint I heard him utter was that the nurses ruined his Mississippi State sweatpants, which were cut off with scissors.  When I returned to visit him the next day, I presented him with a new pair of sweats.</p>

  <p>Some experiences were traumatic due to emotional rather than actual physical harm, and a few of these occurred on our extended bike rides.  Eastabuchie was a map dot, at best, but it held the nearest gas station, which was about 4 miles from our homes.  One summer, in the middle of July, we began making regular pilgrimages on our bikes to the gas station, about once every two weeks.  With our pockets full of change, we rode to the station and cashed in on Nehi peach sodas, ice cream sandwiches, and candy bars.  Savoring our sugary snacks, we would sit on the sidewalk outside the store.  The normal route to the store and back involved traversing a small winding road that ran in front of our homes.  About 2 miles down the road, it paralleled Highway 11 with a busy railroad track between the two roads.  When we heard a train approaching, we placed pennies on the track to be flattened.  Now these were big freight trains and after they passed it was nearly impossible to find our pennies.  Once or twice, we were present when the Amtrak flew by blasting its horn at the railroad crossing.  If we stood too close when it passed, we felt dizzy and slightly nauseous, so we learned to watch from a distance.</p>

  <p>One sweltering afternoon, we decided to return home from the Eastabuchie store via Highway 11 because it seemed like a faster route.  About a quarter of a mile down the highway, the shoulder of the road stopped along with any illusion of safety or enhanced speed.  What followed was a real-life game of Frogger as the steady stream of cars caused us to alternate between pedaling our bikes a few feet, just enough to start moving, and jumping into the tall grass along the side of the road.  As they sped by, some travelers honked to pay homage to our stupidity.  The progress was slow and demoralizing.  Soon we ditched the idea of riding and begrudgingly walked our bikes in the grass until we reached the railroad crossing two miles up the highway.  Back on familiar ground, we declared Highway evil &mdash; a judgment that we remembered later in our lives.</p>

  <p>Behind the Eastabuchie gas station, there was an old decrepit cemetery, which was rumored to hold the graves of civil war soldiers.  The rumor may have been factual, as we saw a story on the local news station about grave robbers who were caught digging up caskets in the cemetery to steal muskets and other relics.  Then again, even the imaginary legends we derived seemed true as we recited regularly added new details each time.  True or not, the story piqued our interests and one afternoon, as we enjoyed our peach sodas on the sidewalk, we succeed in psyching ourselves up enough to visit the cemetery.</p>

  <p>Neglected for several years, the cemetery was filled with scraggly brush and imposing live oaks.  The low, sprawling limbs of the oaks reminded me of monster arms with knots that looked like elbows and a gradual tampering in girth to branches that resembled bony fingers.  Thick masses of gray moss draped from the limbs nearly touching the dusty ground below.  Even in broad daylight, the cemetery was cast in darkness under the shadows of these ancient trees.  As we pushed open the rusty iron gate with its ornamental spikes, it emitted an eerie creak.  We tiptoed into the sinister necropolis and jumped at the caw of a crow taking flight from a nearby limb and then sweeping over us.  A faint breeze rustled the monsters' fingers causing strange shadows to dance on the ground and tombstones.  I felt my heart thumping wildly as the last of our courage vanished like a vapor.  In our overloaded minds, we assumed our trespass had disturbed the dead souls that were seeking revenge for the recent thefts.  We scurried back to the gate, stumbling over sticks and each other until we reached our bikes.  Mounting our trusty steeds, we pedaled back home at break neck speed, never looking back, and setting a new time record in the process.  Sleep came with difficulty for the next few nights as we thought about the spirits we had possibly disturbed.  As usual, each day the fear diminished and we resumed our trips to the store.  But we never set foot in that cemetery again.</p>

  <p>The Eastabuchie gas station was torn down several years ago to make way for a larger station complete with a restaurant where you can get a greasy burger and fries.  I've stopped at the store a few times to top off my tank.  As I pump gas, my mind is flooded with the memories we made so near to where I stand.  Staring at the sidewalk, I can almost hear our laughter as I think about us enjoying our snacks, which we were free at home but somehow tasted better on our rides.  The sound of a train horn prompts me to look around at the railroad tracks and imagine us sacrificing pennies on the rail while waving at the conductor hoping he'll toot his horn.  I glance at the old cemetery, now well maintained, and picture us racing by on our bikes looking like we saw ghosts.  Some of the details fade as I get older, but I'll always cherish them and never totally forget them.  They aren't the kind of experiences one would recommend or hope to repeat, but they are as vital to our story as the swirling brush strokes in a Van Gogh.</p>
